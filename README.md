# Why

**TL;DR**

Waist (around belly button) 42"

Weight 86.7kg

Can't button jeans

Feel like crap

## Day -1

Breakfast - cereal, coffee and a cream croissant 

Lunch - leftover soup from day before and some cheese on toast

[Fast800](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fast-800-combine-intermittent-long-term/dp/1780723628/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=fast+800&qid=1615143147&sr=8-2) is delivered. I read about half of it. Having done the 5:2 diet I wanted a more hardcore approach. Mosley is credible and bases his books on current research.

Final snack at 8pm - 2 slices of cheese on toast with onion and salad cream (nom!)

Lots of cups of coffee throughout day

## Day 0

I read most of the rest of Fast800 and check out some of the recipes. I make a shopping list and wander off to Morrison's. While in Morrison's I revise my plans and decide to kick off the diet with a small fast - nothing major, maybe 2-3 days if I can manage it. I've tried this once before and managed 2.5 days before cracking in the middle of the night and gorging on sardine sandwiches and cornflakes...

I order [ketosis strips](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B084VKSW5G/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) a [blood sugar monitor](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08146YKWY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and some [meal replacement shake](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0013GKCE4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) just because...

7.06pm - fucking starving and pretty grumpy. Almost 24 hours since last meal. Had about five cups of black coffee and water so far today.

Midnight - Stomach rumnbling. Can't stop thinking about eating. I know I'll never get to sleep. I crack. Half a tin of lentil and bacon soup, 2 baby beetroot and some small slices of cheese...
